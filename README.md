# Text File Analyzer

## Overview

This repository contains Java programs that analyze a text file to perform various operations such as word frequency analysis, identifying the most frequent words, and more. The programs are designed to read a text file, store the words in a dictionary, and allow the user to interactively explore different statistics about the text.

## Coursework

These files are part of an assignment for a CSC 142 (Computer Programming 1) course. The main focus of this assignment is on file handling, string manipulation, and implementing basic data structures to store and retrieve information efficiently.

## Files

1. **`TextFileAnalyzer.java`**:
   - Reads a text file and performs operations such as:
     - Counting the frequency of each word.
     - Displaying words with a frequency above a specified threshold.
     - Offering a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

2. **`ExtraCredit.java`**:
   - Extends the functionality of `TextFileAnalyzer.java` with additional features, including:
     - Counting the total number of repeated words.
     - Identifying the most frequent word(s) in the text.
     - Listing the line numbers where a specific word appears.

## Usage

- **Compile and Run**: Use a Java compiler to compile and run the programs. For example:
  ```bash
  javac TextFileAnalyzer.java
  java TextFileAnalyzer
